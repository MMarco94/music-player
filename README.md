# Tambourine Music Player

A music player for your local music library.

Tenets:

- Linux first
- Local only: no internet connection will ever be established.
- Read only: your music will be accessed only in read mode.
- Stateless: no cache/database/whatever will be created. The metadata in your songs _are_ the database.
- Imperfect: there will be use-cases that are not solved by this software, and that's fine.

## Features
