# Music Player

A music player for your local music library.

Tenets:
 - Local only: no internet connection will ever be established.
 - Read only: your music will be accessed only in read mode.
 - Stateless: no cache/database/whatever will be created. The metadata in your songs _are_ the database.
 - Imperfect: there will be use-cases that are not solved by this software, and that's fine.
